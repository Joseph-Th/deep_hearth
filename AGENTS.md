# Deep Hearth Agent Guide

**Role:** Project execution card.
**Profiles:** Universal, Stateful Application, Deterministic System, Automated Behavior Evaluation
**BCA policy:** ratchet

**Rust agent diagnostics:** advisory. Use bounded, uncertainty-driven commands from [`tools/README.md`](tools/README.md); they are not BCA or completion gates. [`TESTING.md`](TESTING.md) owns verification.

Workspace [`../AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md) owns coordination; [`README.md`](README.md) owns project routing.

## Workspace contract

Applies to every agent in every harness. Source, rationale, and evidence: [../AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md).

The user is a solo developer. Precedence: current request → this contract → project card → standards. This is a safety kernel, not a prescribed workflow. **Hard** rules survive lower-level advice.

### AG-1 Finish the work

Finish the authorized task. On open-ended goals, iterate from evidence until the goal is met or useful in-scope improvements are exhausted; pivot around blockers instead of stopping at them.

### AG-2 Make the calls yourself

Make routine in-scope decisions yourself. Read the project card once, identify the owner and proof route, then work. Ask only when a choice materially changes the deliverable and cannot be inferred.

### AG-3 Write only in your project (hard)

Write only in the requested project. Read-only sibling inspection is allowed when it materially helps. Do not write to the workspace root, parent, or siblings; use project-ignored output or OS temp for scratch.

### AG-4 Done means the user's copy works (hard)

Verify the result in the user's actual copy, including the release, deployment, or running app when applicable. Use the smallest complete project lane and [`REVIEW.md`](../REVIEW.md) for consequential code. Claim only checked results.

### AG-5 Look at what you made

Run or render changed visual, audio, interactive, or published output and inspect the real result against project references and [`STANDARDS_QUALITY.md`](../STANDARDS_QUALITY.md). Tests do not prove appearance.

### AG-6 Real behavior over proxies

Prefer observed product behavior over proxy success. Use tests, harnesses, validators, and metrics as evidence; fix production root causes and proxy divergence rather than weakening gates or hardcoding outcomes.

### AG-7 Answer first, then stop talking

Answer questions directly. Reports state changes, verification limits, and required user action; keep long audit material in project files instead of chat.

### AG-8 Own mistakes; trust the user's evidence

On a reported failure, re-check your work before blaming setup. Try a capability before claiming it is unavailable.

### AG-9 The outcome outranks the process

Skip ceremony and optional diagnostics when they cost more than they protect. Do not skip the proof required by AG-4 through AG-6 or any hard rule.

### AG-10 Leave nothing running

Run automation without disrupting the desktop. Stop task-owned processes, release locks, and remove scratch; never kill or replace the user's program silently.

### AG-11 Git: `main`, commit, push (hard)

Work on `main`; branches or worktrees only when asked. Commit and push verified work unless told not to. Stage task-owned paths explicitly in dirty trees and never discard or sweep in unrelated work.

### AG-12 Current docs describe the present

Update the authority for changed behavior. Keep history and session notes out of current docs and comments.

### AG-13 CI is local; GitHub Actions are banned (hard)

Use repository-owned local verification. Never create, enable, invoke, or push `.github/workflows/`.

### Optional workspace accelerator

Use native navigation first. If cold-start routing is still expensive or ambiguous, run:

```text
python ../tools/agent_context.py brief deep_hearth <task ...>
```

It returns bounded authority, verification, and likely-source evidence. Tool output is evidence, not authority. Use `python ../tools/agent_context.py --help` only when a specific unresolved question justifies a deeper probe. No shared analysis command is a prerequisite to editing.

## Operating protocol

Use the [`README.md`](README.md) task map to resolve `authority / owner / stage / flow / proof`. Search by
canonical operation or durable identity and widen only for a crossed owner edge or failing proof. Extend the
existing owner and operation path instead of creating parallel state, legality, or test-only surfaces.

## Guardrails

- Change consequential behavior only through its authoritative subsystem and canonical operation. Tests, harnesses, and tools reuse production paths.
- Preserve deterministic continuation, strict trusted-load validation, checked physical arithmetic, typed ownership, and exact represented matter, fluid, and energy accounting.
- Core systems perform no implicit external IO; adapters own external effects.
- Remove obsolete code and stale documentation. Do not add compatibility scaffolding, test-only public APIs, fake callers, or broad warning suppressions without an active contract.

## Completion

Use [`TESTING.md`](TESTING.md) for the smallest complete proof. Documentation-only changes run
`python tools/check_authority_docs.py`. Review the task-scoped diff and update only authorities whose truth
changed.
